# Book Club Finder

Book Club Finder is a simple, single page website for Internatioanl students in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The website is for students who are studying in Amsterdam and would like to join a book club in order to get together to discuss books and socialise. The website was created because everyone around me was always mentioning the idea of book clubs and how it is just not possible for them to join a club. The website acts as a way to help students get in touch with the people who run and organise these clubs and eventually join a club since all the information that they might need is presented in a concise way without too much unnecessary detail.

## User Experience
  ### Client Objective
  The aim of this ficticious service is to provide potential users with information about joining a book club and helping them participate in one. Over the years, the number of international students has grown significantly in The Netherlands, specially in Amsterdam. Most of these students are new to the city and do not have the time to spend too much energy on finding the right extracurricular activities that they like because of how demanding everything else can be. 
  
  The Book Club finder is a simple webiste that provides information regarding why joining a book club can be a good idea and how the service can help them to get a better experience by joining a club. Along with this the owners provide an external video source that outlines what to expect from a book club and benefits of joining one just to to show a different opinion. 

  ### User Stories

  ## Design 
  ### Colour Scheme
  The colour palette below was used to deign the website. The palette was created using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
  ![Colour palette](READ.ME%20images/Book%20club%20finder%20color%20palette.png)
  <br>

  ### Typography 
  All fonts used in the project were from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  - The logo of the webiste uses the font **Courgette**.
  - All the headings use the font **Chivo** with sans-serif as backup.
  - All the paragraph elements use the font **Titillium Web** with sans-serif as backup.
This font combination was chosen to give the website a clean and modern look that . This combination was generated using [fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/). 
<br>

### Imagery 
The webiste only has one pciture that acts as a hero image. The image is from [Picjumbo](https://picjumbo.com/i-love-reading-heart-in-book-pages/) and credited in the [credits](#credits)
<br>

## Features 
### General Features
The website has a logo at the beginning. Followed by the logo, there is a navigation bar that takes you to the desired sections. 
![Logo + navigation bar ]()
<br>
There are three main sections, each with its own purpose. 
<br>

The first section is the **About Us** which is a short description of what the service is for. This section was kept short to acts as a landing page that provides information without taking too much time. The user can just look at it quickly and moving on. 
![About us and landing page](/READ.ME%20images/About%20Us.png)

<br>

The second section is **Why join us** and outlines why you should join a book club, specifically by using the book club service. There are 6 column cards that state and elaborate on the reason. The image below shows what a column card looks like. It shows what the service offers and how it can be beneficial for the user. 
![An example of a reason](/READ.ME%20images/Reason.png)

<br>
This section also contains a Youtube video which is credited in the [credits](#credits) section. It provides a few reasons to join a book club. This video does not in any way encourage people to use the service but simply states why being part of a club can be beneficial. The column cards have more to do with why the service should be used whereas the video provides general reasons to join a book club.

<br>

The third section is the **Contact** section which provides user with a way of contacting the service. The information includes:
* An Address and the operating times for people to visit. 
* A contact form to get in touch regarding sign-ups and questions. 
* A google map to help with directions which shows the relevant parts of the city.

The footer provides users with all the social media links

<br>

### Future Implementations
In the future, I would like to add more functionality and features to the website in order to improve the user experience by including: 
* Add additional pages for testimonials with a mini gallery. 
* Adding a hamburger menu style for navigation, specifically for mobile users. I did not implement this because all my nav elements were visible and had enough space without obstructing the user experience. 
* Implement continuous navigation using the scrollspy bootstrap with a fixed navigation bar so that the user knew which section/page they were on. I did not use it in this project because I was not comfortable with bootstrapping. 
* Adding a section/page for future events that the service can organise so users can know where they are. 
 <!--* Adding a portal of sorts where people can see which group they are currently with contact info of members of their respective clubs-->
<!--* A page for book reviews that are being read by all the clubs.-->

<br>

### Accessibility
Keeping accessibility in mind, I have ensured that: 
* The colour contrast meets the minimum requirement since the rating is AA. 
* Aria-label were used where required to make the website screen-reader friendly.
* Using semantic HTML.
