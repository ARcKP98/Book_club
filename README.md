# Book Club Finder

Book Club Finder is a simple, single page website for Internatioanl students in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The website is for students who are studying in Amsterdam and would like to join a book club in order to get together to discuss books and socialise. The website was created because everyone around me was always mentioning the idea of book clubs and how it is just not possible for them to join a club. The website acts as a way to help students get in touch with the people who run and organise these clubs and eventually join a club since all the information that they might need is presented in a concise way without too much unnecessary detail.

## User Experience
  ### Client Objective
  The aim of this ficticious service is to provide potential users with information about joining a book club and helping them participate in one. Over the years, the number of international students has grown significantly in The Netherlands, specially in Amsterdam. Most of these students are new to the city and do not have the time to spend too much energy on finding the right extracurricular activities that they like because of how demanding everything else can be. 
  
  The Book Club finder is a simple webiste that provides information regarding why joining a book club can be a good idea and how the service can help them to get a better experience by joining a club. Along with this the owners provide an external video source that outlines what to expect from a book club and benefits of joining one just to to show a different opinion. 

  ### User Stories
  #### New User Goals
  * I want to find out what the Book Club Finder does.
  * I want the information to be easy to read without looking too much. No need to toggle between pages.
  * I want a way to connect using social media and contact information of the service for questions. 
  <!-- * I want to see how using this service to join a Bookclub can improve my experience and how they operate. -->
  * I want to see how using this service to join a Bookclub is a better option for me.


  #### Returning User Goals 
  * I want a way to contact the service digitally or in-person(Address).
  * I want to refer the service to others who might be interested without saying a lot.
  * I want to know how the service can help me if I am not sure. 
  

  ## Design 
  ### Colour Scheme
  The colour palette below was used to deign the website. The palette was created using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
  ![Colour palette](/readme-images/book-club-finder-colour-palette.png)
  <br>

  ### Typography 
  All fonts used in the project were from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  - The logo of the webiste uses the font **Courgette**.
  - All the headings use the font **Chivo** with sans-serif as backup.
  - All the paragraph elements use the font **Titillium Web** with sans-serif as backup.
This font combination was chosen to give the website a clean and modern look that is visually appealing. This combination was generated using [fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/). 
<br>

### Imagery 
The webiste only has one pciture that acts as a hero image. The image is from [Picjumbo](https://picjumbo.com/i-love-reading-heart-in-book-pages/) and credited in the [credits](#credits)

## Features 
### General Features
The website has a logo at the beginning. Followed by the logo, there is a navigation bar that takes you to the desired sections. 
![Logo + navigation bar ](/readme-images/logo-and-nav.png)
<br>
There are three main sections, each with its own purpose. 
<br>

The first section is the **About Us** which is a short description of what the service is for. This section was kept short to acts as a landing page that provides information without taking too much time. The user can just look at it quickly and moving on. 
![About us and landing page](/readme-images/about-us.png)

<br>

The second section is **Why join us** and outlines why you should join a book club, specifically by using the book club service. There are 6 column cards that state and elaborate on the reason. The image below shows what a column card looks like. It shows what the service offers and how it can be beneficial for the user. 
![An example of a reason](/readme-images/reason.png)

<br>
This section also contains a Youtube video which is credited in the [credits](#credits) section. It provides a few reasons to join a book club. This video does not in any way encourage people to use the service but simply states why being part of a club can be beneficial. The column cards have more to do with why the service should be used whereas the video provides general reasons to join a book club.

<br>

The third section is the **Contact** section which provides user with a way of contacting the service. The information includes:
* An Address and the operating times for people to visit. 
* A contact form to get in touch regarding sign-ups and questions. 
* A google map to help with directions which shows the relevant parts of the city. 
![Contact form and map](/readme-images/contact-info.png)
<br>

The footer provides users with all the social media links
<br>
![Footer](/readme-images/footer.png)

<br>

### Future Implementations
In the future, I would like to add more functionality and features to the website in order to improve the user experience by including: 
* Add additional pages for testimonials with a mini gallery. 
* Adding a hamburger menu style for navigation, specifically for mobile users. I did not implement this because all my nav elements were visible and had enough space without obstructing the user experience. 
* Implement continuous navigation using the scrollspy bootstrap with a fixed navigation bar so that the user knew which section/page they were on. I did not use it in this project because I was not comfortable with bootstrapping. 
* Adding a section/page for future events that the service can organise so users can know where they are. 
* I would only like to add a part of the youtube video instead of the entire video so that the point of the video is more clear.
 <!--* Adding a portal of sorts where people can see which group they are currently with contact info of members of their respective clubs-->
<!--* A page for book reviews that are being read by all the clubs.-->

<br>

### Accessibility
Keeping accessibility in mind, I have ensured that: 
* The colour contrast meets the minimum requirement since the rating is AA. 
* Aria-label were used where required to make the website screen-reader friendly.
* Using semantic HTML.

<br>

## Technologies Used
### Languages Used
* HTML5
* CSS3

<br>

### Libraries and Programs Used

## Testing
### Functionality testing 
The website was tested on a wide range of screen options to ensures responsiveness. The devices used were: 
- Macbook air(2560x1600)
- iPhone 11 (320x568)
<br>
Chrome DevTools was used to check responsiveness by emulating different screen sizes. This esnured that all the content was presented on the page as intended without any major misalignments.

### Issues discovered
The table below outlines the issues and bugs that came up during development and after initial deployment. 
| Issue|  Solution | Discovered by
| ------ | --------- | -----------
| The map and contact form were too spread-out on 4k monitors.  | Add a mrgin-left to the map so that it looks better. | Me while developing
| The aspect ratio and styling of the image was not correct which led to a bad score. | Added an object-fit declaration for the image and conveted from a .JPEG to .WebP| Lighthouse
| The footer elements were not being centered despite specifying the rule| The footer content was broken down into classes and then  used flex-display to center the elements. | Me with help from tutor support
| Error with image source where "width=100%" was not acceptable in the HTML document.| Styled the image with CSS | W3C validator
| With maps, allowfullscreen attribute was set to true. | Removed the attribute to improve preformance.| W3C validators
| By setting the scroll-style to smooth performance was affected | Removed smooth-scroll from the CSS | Lighthouse
| CSS error where units for height were missing. | Added units to the mentioned properties. | W3C validator
| Vendor extensions were throwing a warning | Identified their importance and removed them. | W3C validator
<!-- maybe remove smooth-scroll comment -->
<br>

### Known bugs
- The website still has a cache issue where the cache policy is not defined. It affects the performance by slowing down the laoding of website elements like google maps, youtube video, and fonts.
- There are errors logged on console because of google maps. This affects the best practice score. 

### Mentor advice/guidance
- Improve my colour scheme since I had 5 different colours for each section. 
- Use column cards for my why join us section. 
- Suggesting to use a different image to improve visibility.
- For providing me with useful resources like READ.ME samples.
