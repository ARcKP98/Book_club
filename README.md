# Book Club Finder

Book Club Finder is a simple, single page website for Internatioanl students in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The site is for students who are studying in Amsterdam and would like to join a book club in order to get together to discuss books and socialise. The site was created because everyone around me was always mentioning the idea of book clubs and how it is just not possible for them to join a club. The site acts as a way to help students get in touch with the people who run and organise these clubs and eventually join a club since all the information that they might need is presented in a concise way without too much unnecessary detail.

## User Experience
  ### Client Objective
  The aim of this ficticious service is to provide potential users with information about joining a book club and helping them participate in one. Over the years, the number of international students has grown significantly in The Netherlands, specially in Amsterdam. Most of these students are new to the city and do not have the time to spend too much energy on finding the right extracurricular activities that they like because of how demanding everything else can be. 
  
  The Book Club finder is a simple webiste that provides information regarding why joining a book club can be a good idea and how the service can help them to get a better experience by joining a club. Along with this the owners provide an external video source that outlines what to expect from a book club and benefits of joining one just to to show a different opinion.
