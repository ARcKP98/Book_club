# Book Club Finder

Book Club Finder is a simple, single page website for Internatioanl students in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The site is for students who are studying in Amsterdam and would like to join a book club in order to get together to discuss books and socialise. The site acts as a way to help students get in touch with the people who run and organise these clubs and eventually join a club.
