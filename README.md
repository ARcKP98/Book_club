# Book Club Finder

Book Club Finder is a simple, single page website for Internatioanl students in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The site is for students who are studying in Amsterdam and would like to join a book club in order to get together to discuss books and socialise. The site was created because everyone around me was always mentioning the idea of book clubs and how it is just not possible for them to join a club. The site acts as a way to help students get in touch with the people who run and organise these clubs and eventually join a club since all the information that they might need is presented in a concise way without too much unnecessary detail.
