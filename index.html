            <div class="why">
                <h2>Student friendly</h2>
                <p>We are the only facilitator that has book clubs just for students. We know from personal experince
                    that
                    how difficult it is to find a book club that you can attend while managing university. We cater to
                    student
                    schedules and connect others who are in the same boat as you.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="why">
                <h2>International community</h2>
                <p>Our club has tons of Internationals who come to Amsterdam to study at university. So you can be
                    assured
                    that language won't be a barrier when you join our club since everyone speaks English.

        <div class="reasons">
            <div class="why">
                <h2>Exclusivity</h2>
                <p>To esnure you get the best experince, we focus on creating small groups of around 3-8 people. We
                    believe
                    in the notion of quality over quantity and have found that having intimate groups works better than
                    having
                    large groups. This ensures that no one is left out of discussions.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="why">
                <h2>For Fun</h2>
                <p>Life is stressful and having a place where you can wind down with others who also share a love for
                    reading is
                    a nice way to de-stress. Not only can you read books and discuss them, you also get to socilaise
                    with
                    others
                    and make connections for life. We also arrange meetups for all the groups atleast once every two
                    months.

                <h2>Great Selection</h2>
                <p>Not only can you get together with others to read books, we can also offer you great recommendations
                    if you want to avoid decision decision fatigue. You don't have to choose the book we recommend and
                    are more
                    than welcome to pick the one your club agrees on but our current members love to use this suggestion
                    since
                    most people can be busy to make a decision. Get in touch to know more about this selection.

                <p>Once a month, we arrange a gathering for all our book clubs. This is a great opportunity
                    to meet other book clubs in Amsterdam. We have different events every time there is a gethering,
                    from trivia night to open mic nights. Location will be conveyed before the event.
