                    <h3>We help you find a good reading club in Amsterdam.</h3>

        <h2 id="reason">Why Join Us</h2>
        <div class="why">
            <h2>Student friendly</h2>
                <p>We are the only facilitator that has book clubs just for students. We know from personal experince that
                how difficult it is to find a book club that you can attend while managing university. We cater to student 
                schedules and connect others who are in the same boat as you.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why">
            <h2>International community</h2>
                <p>Our club has tons of Internationals who come to Amsterdam to study at university. So you can be assured
                that language won't be a barrier when you join our club since everyone speaks English. 
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why">
            <h2>Exclusivity</h2>
                <p>To esnure you get the best experince, we focus on creating small groups of around 3-8 people. We believe
                    in the notion of quality over quantity and have found that having intimate groups works better than having 
                    large groups. This ensures that no one is left out of discussions. 
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why">
            <h2>For Fun</h2>
                <p>Life is stressful and having a place where you can wind down with others who also share a love for reading is
                    a nice way to de-stress. Not only can you read books and discuss them, you also get to socilaise with others
                    and make connections for life. We also arrange meetups for all the groups atleast once every two months.
